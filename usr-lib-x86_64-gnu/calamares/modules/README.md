While trying to install the Debian 12 Bookworm system from a live boot version I downloaded at First Baptist Church here in Norman, OK, on their WiFi, I realized that the config files showed an option to choose systemd-boot or sb-shim instead of grub. I could not find the option anywhere, and since it is pure Debian, it didn't make sense to me for there to be configuration files that sounded like they were written downstream. I did a "find / -name initramfscfg" to find where that particular module was, and discovered this folder that was full of things I didn't know existed. Everything else I had been modifying was in /etc or /var/lib. 

I am attempting to copy everything in the /usr/lib/x86_64-gnu/ folder to this Hall of Fame repository under the usr-lib-x86_64-gnu folder, but any README.md files are commentary added by me. Also, for the most part, I am just copying the folders over. But there may be a situation where a folder was created for the sake of sanity because of the 100 file limit that GitHub has in the drag and drop browser feature. I don't really know how to use the CLI version well enough to do this that way, so any discrepancies in folder permissions, if it preserves them at all, could be due to that.
