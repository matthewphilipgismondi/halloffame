While trying to install Debian 12 Bookworm on my laptop, I noticed there were modules referenced that I could not find. With the installer open to the timezone selection frame, I did a "find / -name initramfscfg" and found this folder in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu that had a whole bunch of things I didn't know existed.
