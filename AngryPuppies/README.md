I tried to download Puppy Linux, but was having a hard time with it and Secure Boot. So it got placed on hold. Today when I was looking through the installer files, there were several disks that looked like they were additions someone had added as some kind of patch or something. I don't know, and it's my birthday (or it was) so I would much rather be having fun. But since I am alone and not by choice, I am trying to at least do something helpful to the greater good or whatever it is out there that might find these files useful. And it is important to say that Puppy Linux deserves better representation than this "We don't really care if it works" attitude that one of the files stated. I don't know who created these assuming they are hacks. I don't really need to know, but someone find them and take them down. I revoke fleabane if that helps.
